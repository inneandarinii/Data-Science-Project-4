# Data-Science-Project-4

I recently completed a project about Predicting Housing prices using Advanced Regression Techniques!


🔍 Key Highlights:
Machine Learning Model: Tested various regression models, including linear regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, and XGBoost. Selected the model with the highest score to predict 'saleprice' for new housing data.

🎯 Project Objectives: The main objectives of the project were to identify variables with significant impact on 'Saleprice,' develop a predictive model for the 'saleprice' variable, and predict new housing data using a machine learning model that produces high-scoring results.
